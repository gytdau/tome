Tome is an educational programming language with English-like syntax. It's made for people who are novice coders to help them learn programming. It compiles down into Javascript.
You can [try it out online](http://gytdau.github.io/tome/) or [read about Tome's features.](https://github.com/gytdau/tome/blob/gh-pages/SPEC.md)

## Examples

Check out these example Tome programs:

This is the Hello World program.
```
Show "Hello World".
(It's that easy!)
```
You can probably figure out what the programs below do just by looking at them.
```
Count until a reaches 20:
Show "'a' is now: " + a.
End.
```

```
Set food as ["pie", "cake", "muffins"].
For every item in food do:
Show "Mmm, I'd love some " + item + " right now!"
End.
```
