Tome is an educational programming language with English-like syntax. It's made for people who are novice coders to help them learn programming. It compiles down into Javascript.

## Examples

Check out these example Tome programs:

This is the Hello World program.
```
Show "Hello World".
(It's that easy!)
```
Count to 20.
```
Count until a reaches 20:
Show "'a' is now: " + a.
End.
```
